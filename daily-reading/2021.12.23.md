### [2020 ICLR] Invariant Rationalization
Idea: the real caulsal rational should be environment invariant, that is, p(Y|Z) = p(Y|Z, E), where Z is the rationale.  

Method:
Split the dataset on environment to change the prior distribution of causal rationale. For causal rational, the introduction of environment will not bring extra information, while for correlation rational, environment can provide some extra information about the prior of causal rational.
$$
min L_i^* + \lambda h(L_i^* - L_e^*)
$$
$L_i^*$ is environment independent prediction loss, $L_e^*$ is environment-aware prediction loss.
> MMI: maximum mutual information  
RAM: invariant risk minimization  
antonymy: agnostic - aware
