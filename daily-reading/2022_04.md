## \[2020 ACL\] Pretrained Transformers Improve Out-of-Distribution Robustness
Investigate the robustness of different models including Transformers. Good performance  on IID is not equal to robustness. So it is important to see whether Transformers of good performance are more robust.

Metrics for Robustness:
- Generalization on OOD samples
- OOD samples detection (False Alarm Rate with anomaly score)
- > Anomaly score is the confidence (uncertainty) of model predictions

Observasions:
- Transformers are more robustness
- Large model not eaqual to robustness

Analysis:
- Self-supervised learning task is critical for robustness
- Data diversity is important
