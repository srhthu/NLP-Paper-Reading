## \[ICLR-2020\] Distributionally robust neural networksfor group shifts: On the importance of regularization for worst-case generalization.
**Group DRO**

### Idea
Assumption: The test distribution falls into the simplex of distributions of training groups. Thus, to minimize the cross entropy of test is equal to minimizing the cross entropy of training groups. Then to improve the worst group performance.

### Method
Re-weighting the loss of samples from different groups to amplify the influence of samples from the worst group.

## \[ICML 2020\] A Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations
**SimCLR**

Contrastive learning. Minimize the representations similarity of same samples and maximize the representations similarity of different samples.

Systemetically investigate the effects of data augmentation methods, batch_size, ..
