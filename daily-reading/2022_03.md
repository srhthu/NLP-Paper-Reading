## \[ICLR-2020\] Distributionally robust neural networksfor group shifts: On the importance of regularization for worst-case generalization.
**Group DRO**

### Idea
Assumption: The test distribution falls into the simplex of distributions of training groups. Thus, to minimize the cross entropy of test is equal to minimizing the cross entropy of training groups. Then to improve the worst group performance.

### Method
Re-weighting the loss of samples from different groups to amplify the influence of samples from the worst group.
